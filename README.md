# Current development Issues/Problems

---I am plannig on my own streamer and itegrating it , resulting more freedom and control---

1. occasionally Jittered/laggy playback slider(cuz yt doesn't lemme do it directly wth keys)
2. Limited Search Results per page( provides faster response)
3. No segregation of albums and videos & no profile/album preview (Cuz i am stuck in other bugs)
4. Gsignup available but with localhost only and user is required to have the account logged in the defined browser ( login works for 2yrs prob)
5. ~~Ad-Block is still unstable(its webdriver. ¯\ _(ツ)_ /¯ notmyfault)~~ this one is almost fixed ig
6. ~~No network connectivity notifications , but is being tracked~~ notifications are popping now .. network connectivity is being worked
7. No Video Playback: this one is not possible cuz iam directly using raw stream data; possible work around is caching it first but isnt healthy for ssd users ; yes i know i can use vlc but it ads up with more dependencies plus it will play it externally which would be...
8. Dynamics arent always attractive (cuz im not caching the images) hence needs a better pallete algo
9. voice search isnt implemented(it is simple) becoz search provider is not yet finished 
10. Top charts for songs not visible unless logged similar case with age-restricted content(i think this part might be scraped if i scrap gsignup)
